<b>The Objective of Blackjack</b><br>
Beat The Dealer. There are some misconceptions about the objective of the game of blackjack but at the simplest level all you are trying to do is beat the dealer.<br><br>

<b>How do you beat the dealer?</b><br>
-By drawing a hand value that is higher than the dealerâ€™s hand value<br>
-By the dealer drawing a hand value that goes over 21.<br>
-By drawing a hand value of 21 on your first two cards, when the dealer does not.<br>
<br>
<br><b>How do you lose to the dealer? </b><br>
-Your hand value exceeds 21.<br>
-The dealers hand has a greater value than yours at the end of the round<br>
